Welcome to the Github website for Computational Catalysis Course (CHEG-5395-4995) offered by the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Connecticut.

### Overview ###
Your hands-on practices, Homework 4 and final project of this course will [Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)](http://github.com/vossjo/ase-espresso). We also use [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and other tools to visualize, manipulate and post-process calculations. Computing resources for this course are provided by [UCONN's HPC facility on the Storrs campus](https://hpc.uconn.edu/storrs/).

This website provides useful instructions and resources for research in our group, including but not limited to:

### Getting Started ###
* [Setting up accounts on HPC clusters.](HPC/PREREQUISITE)
* Tutorials
  1. [UNIX Command Lines](Tutorials/UNIX/)
  2. [Python](Tutorials/Python/)

### Conducting Calculations ###
* [Running Jobs on clusters](HPC/Storrs/#batch)
* Introduction to packages.
